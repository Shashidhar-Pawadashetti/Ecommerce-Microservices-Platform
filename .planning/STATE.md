# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-24)

**Core value:** Complete end-to-end purchase journey — signup → browse → cart → checkout → payment → order status → notification — across all services through the gateway, verified by `docker compose up` plus a scripted smoke test.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Contracts & Repo Scaffolding

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap follows the research-validated 10-phase build order; Phase 1 widened to own repo scaffolding (.gitattributes before first Java commit) + pinned version manifest + JSON interop rules
- Phase 9 reframed as cold-start reproducibility audit — each service joins Compose incrementally in its own phase
- Order + Payment kept as one inseparable phase (single Kafka saga; kill/restart redelivery test lives there)
- Gateway placed late deliberately: standalone ports revoked in Phase 7 as its isolation verify

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-Phase 1] Stakeholder sign-off needed on research deviations before contracts freeze: MailHog→Mailpit, Motor→PyMongo AsyncMongoClient
- [Pre-Phase 1] Decide Spring Boot 3.5 posture (OSS EOL 2026-06-30): stay pinned vs bump to Boot 4.0 — record choice in runbook
- [Environment] OneDrive sync on this repo path flagged as file-lock risk during builds — consider excluding project dir from sync
